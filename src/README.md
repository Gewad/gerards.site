# Website Source Files

This folder contains the complete filesystem of the website that will be deployed to the hosting VM.

## Structure

- `index.html` - Main homepage
- `styles.css` - Global stylesheet
- Add additional pages, assets, images, and scripts as needed

## Development

Simply edit the files in this folder. When changes are pushed to the `main` branch, they will be automatically deployed to the hosting VM via FTP.
